# Wikipedia Revisions Reporter

This JavaFX application reports on the most recent changes to a Wikipedia
page. When you provide the name of a Wikipedia article, the application
will make a query to Wikipedia and return the thirty most recent
changes to that page, printing the timestamp and editor's name.

To run the application from within IntelliJ IDEA, 
execute the `run` target that is found under Tasks&rightarrow;application
